### üß© **Phase 1 ‚Äî Data Cleaning & Multivariate Analysis (Modules 1‚Äì3)**

#### **Module Overview**
This phase focused on understanding the dataset, cleaning inconsistencies, and exploring one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and multi-dimensional relationships through visual and statistical methods.

#### **Key Steps**
- **Dataset Exploration:** Loaded and verified `SuicideChina.csv`, analyzed dimensions, column types, and null counts.  
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, standardized categorical values, and handled missing data.  
- **Univariate Analysis:** Analyzed individual variable distributions using histograms, KDE plots, and boxplots.  
- **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:** Explored relationships (`Age` vs `Died`, `Occupation` vs `Method`) and visualized correlations via heatmaps and pairplots.

#### **Key Findings**
- Majority of suicide cases occurred among **rural, farming populations**.  
- **Hanging** and **pesticide ingestion** emerged as dominant methods.  
- **Age** showed a right-skewed distribution (middle-aged and elderly more prone).  
- Strong correlation observed between **Occupation** and **Method**, indicating occupational exposure influence.

### ü§ñ **Reinforcement Learning ‚Äî Conceptual Perspective**

Although not implemented, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** was studied conceptually for dynamic suicide prevention policy modeling.

| Aspect | Supervised Learning | Reinforcement Learning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Input Data** | Labeled samples | Reward feedback from environment |
| **Goal** | Minimize prediction error | Maximize cumulative reward |
| **Example** | Predict suicide fatality | Simulate policy to reduce fatalities |
| **Feedback** | Immediate and direct | Delayed and cumulative |

**Applications:** Healthcare optimization ¬∑ Resource allocation ¬∑ Adaptive policy formulation ¬∑ Mental health intervention design  

---

### üìä **Key Findings Across Phases**

- Suicide fatalities correlate strongly with **occupation (farming)** and **method (pesticide)**.  
- **Hospitalisation** acts as a major protective variable.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction** uncovered two latent components ‚Äî demographic and method-based.  
- **Ridge Regression** achieved the best balance of bias and variance.  
- Conceptually, **Reinforcement Learning** provides a framework for adaptive intervention policy design.

### üß© **Future Scope**

- Extend to **classification models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Integrate **psychological, healthcare, and economic datasets** for holistic insights.  
- Implement **time-series forecasting** to predict long-term suicide trends.  
- Apply **SHAP-based explainability** for transparent and ethical model interpretation.
